# FEM-NMED-TUDELFT
This repository contains code for the Numerical Methods in Engineering Dynamics course as given at the 3mE faculty at the TU Delft in the Netherlands. In the file `basic_fem.py` everything that is required to assemble a mass, $\mathbf{M}$, and stiffness, $\mathbf{M}$, matrix is defined. Elements one can use are bar and beam elements.
